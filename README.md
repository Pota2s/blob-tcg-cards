4 Example cards are posted.
Make a branch to upload your cards, then make a pull request and (maybe) DM blob at @blobtato on discord to get it reviewed and added.
All cards are to be made with the JSON format, no exceptions.
Images only require a link to the image in a CDN, discord's CDN is preferable, imgur is a decent second option.

Rankings.txt is a general guideline to making these cards ratings.
Passives are not to be added by you. Only select people are given rights to add passives.
