# Introduction
4 Example cards are posted.

Make a branch to upload your cards, then make a pull request and (maybe) DM blob at @blobtato on discord to get it reviewed and added.

All cards are to be made with the JSON format, no exceptions. Images only require a link to the image in a CDN, discord's CDN is preferable, imgur is a decent second option.

Rankings.txt is a general guideline to making these cards ratings. Passives are not to be added by you. Only select people are given rights to add passives.
