OVR = Avg of 3 highest stats

(READ)
99 doesn't imply a level of proficiency higher than 90, just a temperament more suited for the respective specialization
By extension, low scores sometimes only indicate less focus on a particular aspect (i.e a stylistic choice), not a lower level of proficiency.

Basic mechanics: Swingblock, Walk, PB, LMB-hold Combo, A-D Strafe, Yaw
Intermediate mechanics: Halfswing, PB Overlaps, Click combos, Shadowswing
Advanced mechanics: Disarm, Swingblock Combos, Counterswings, Overyaw/Instant Yaw

BENCHMARKS/STAT DESCRIPTORS
OFFENSE
~99 OFF : Self explanatory
~90 OFF : An effective offensive package that enables one to compete at the highest level *effective, not all-encompassing - doesn't have to utilize all the offensive mechanics/techs*
~80 OFF : Highly proficient, typically denoting the overspecialized - Weak against certain matchups/has a pronounced weakness
~70 OFF : Mechanically and technically proficient, but isn't offense-oriented in general; This range accounts for the defensive players that are typically seen in regions with higher base ping, and the highly proficient players that are just ever so slightly inconsistent
~60 OFF : Capable of executing high level mechanics/techs and momentary offensive perfection, but is ultimately too unrefined/inconsistent for top level comp
(=)
Readable/static/can't maintain high level offense
~50 OFF : Referring to players with good usage of intermediate mechanics, e.g halfswing/sbed comboing, but aren't mechanically consistent and poised enough for any comp play in general
~40 OFF : The aspiring; mechanically limited/still learning
~30 OFF : Incapable of executing intermediate mechanics
~20 OFF : Average pub players
~10 OFF : New player

DEFENSE - PB-BASED DEFENSE ONLY
~99 DEF: The overspecialized; Capable of pbing flick-based offense at blankpoint/is prepared for niche defending scenarios - pbing laggy players, etc/perfect pattern recognition, muscle memory and aim.
This level of mechanical perfection is hard to come by, considering how pb-based defense is forgone in modern comp play. 99 DEF is specifically reserved for the top tier comp players who are highly defense-oriented
~90 DEF: Near-perfect PBs + a balanced mindset towards defending
~80 DEF: Mechanically proficient, but not overly-inclined
~70 DEF: A bit rough around the edges
~60 DEF: Capable of the intricacies of high level-pbing (Pattern recognition/Overlaps), but isn't mechanically consistent enough to pull it off in high pressure scenarios
~50 DEF: The aspiring; mechanically limited/still learning
~40 DEF: Knows how to PB, but isn't proficient in any sense of the word
~30 DEF: Occasionally perfect blocks
~20 DEF: Never tries to PB
~10 DEF: New player

AGILITY - MOVEMENT-BASED DEFENSE/SENSE OF DISTANCE
~99 AGI: The overspecialized; relies heavily on and EXCEL at utilizing distance/all facets of movement
~90 AGI: Highly movement-oriented to the extent that it bleeds into different aspects of their game (e.g a proficient shadowswinger); Perfect sense of distance that lends itself to a movement-based playstyle that is comp-compatible (e.g comp players on alternative forms)
~80 AGI: Mechanically proficient, but not overly-inclined
~70 AGI: Denoting players whose movement isn't measurably inhibited, but limited due to personal preferences. Might somewhat struggle against exaggerated movement
~60 AGI: Accounting for players with stationary playstyles; minimal movement
~50 AGI: Has a subpar sense for distance (for instance, might somewhat struggle to shadowswing properly and land his/her fullswings against a moving opponent)
~40 AGI: Hasn't fully grasp all the existing movement mechanics (D-side input priority/rolling/etc), and has poor movement in general - bad movement-based defense/can't escape or sustain when low
~30 AGI: Does not move
~20 AGI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL5r3TRmmKE
~10 AGI: New player

REFLEX - RAW REFLEXES/COUNTERSWING ABILITY/HALTING WHEN INTERRUPTED/SPEED OF OFFENSE ON SLAP
~99 REF: Self explanatory
~90 REF: Great but not perfect. For instance, may still occasionally miss out on chances for counter flicks
~80 REF: Generally hits counterswings well and duly disengages when interrupted, but still gets caught off guard every now and then
~70 REF: Average reflexes
~60 REF: Struggles with quick-time maneuvers such as setting up an optimal offensive chain on slap/disengaging upon being interrupted
~50 REF: Slow in reflex-dependent interactions/inconsistent counterswings
~40 REF: The aspiring; mechanically limited/still learning
~30 REF: Poor counterswings/Poor offense on slap
~20 REF: Still learning counters/quick-time interractions
~10 REF: New player

TIMING - ALL THAT REQUIRES ACTIVE TIMING&EXECUTION - SLAPPING/DEFENSE<=>OFFENSE SWITCHING/CHAIN RESETTING/(DEX SWINGING INCLUDED EXCLUSIVELY FOR PLAYERS WHO WERE ONLY ACTIVE DURING ITS LIFETIME)
(Timing for mechanical execution/muscle memory, e.g knowing how to keep halfswinging in a chain, isn't a part of this criteria)
~99 TIM: The specialized, frame perfect timing; Slap-based offense/Slap-resetting-based offense/Punishing turtlers/Switching from offense to defense, defense to offense/Timing for interrupts. Extreme mastery of any/multiple of these skills with good command over the rest = 99 Timing
~90 TIM: Great timing, well-versed in all facets of timing
~80 TIM: Good timing, understands the timing-related techs/intricacies, but execution is still occasionally faulty
~70 TIM: Though inconsistent in their execution, players of this range are capable of advanced timing; some might even possess a timing-centric offensive package.
~60 TIM: The aspiring; mechanically limited/still learning
~50 TIM: Isn't capable of setting up timing-related maneuvers/plays
~40 TIM: Faulty timing that is detrimental to oneself (e.g constantly getting intterupted during combos) 
~30 TIM -> 0 TIM = gradually decreasing proficiency and inclination
